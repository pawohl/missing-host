				<h1>Got your request but &hellip; that's just an IP address</h1>
				<p>
Hi visitor.
I, the webserver, received a request.
Your request. That's the response. My response.
The request didn't contain any host name or the host name is not known to me.
Someone might have pointed a domain name to me, which I do not manage.
That's why <b>I don't know which site you would like me to show</b>.
Using curl or wget? Make sure you specify the host header correctly.
Domain holder? Check your A and AAAA records!
